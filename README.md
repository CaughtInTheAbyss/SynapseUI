# Installation
The installation is super simple. 

Simply head over to the ["Releases"](https://github.com/asunax-aaa/SynapseUI/releases) tab and download the latest SynapseUI.exe from under the Assets.

Once downloaded, simply drag and drop this into your already pre-existing Synapse X folder and open it.

`Note:`
First run may take longer as the UI will auto-download all the required files.

This Synapse UI can auto-update both itself and the additional files. Meaning you will automatically get the latest version of this UI.

# Key shortcuts
- Ctrl+S : Save opened script file.
- Ctrl+Shift+S : Save script files as.
- Ctrl+O : Open script file into editor.

# Notes
1. Make sure to add this custom UI to your antivirus exclusions list, this is obviously not a virus, it's an open-source project.
2. Multi-RBLX is buggy, always has been - its the nature of the method. To get best results: 
    - Make sure you turn Multi-RBLX `ON` first THEN open up your roblox clients. \*Turning Multi-RBLX `OFF` closes all clients but one.

I will be updating this UI at some point in the future with new features and bug fixes, DM me with any known bug fixes / any features you might want added.

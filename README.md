# Installation
The installation is super simple. 

Simply head over to the ["Releases"](https://github.com/asunax-aaa/SynapseUI/releases) tab and download the latest SynapseUI.exe from under the Assets.

Once downloaded, simply drag and drop this into your already pre-existing Synapse X folder and open it!

`Note`:
First run may take longer as the UI will auto-download all the required files.

Auto-download?? Yes that's right!! This Synapse UI can auto-update both itself and the additional files. Meaning you will automatically get the latest version of UI.

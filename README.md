# MAJOR ISSUE
Execution will not work AT ALL. This is unfixable on my part until Synapse actually fixes sxlib. You won't need to reinstall the UI when sxlib is fixed as long as you have version 1.0.15 or higher installed.

# Fork Changes
1. Bolded title text. I always liked that more.
2. Built in script hub changed images.
3. Aligned the attatch button to the script tree.
4. Reinstall Roblox button.
5. README modifications.

Everything else in is the same, except for some minor tweaks with the credits and links.

# SynapseUI
A custom Synapse X user interface with the following changes:
1. A brand new look! But, just like the same old Synapse you know.
2. A new color scheme!
3. Animations!
4. Custom controls. no Bunifu UI skidded shit!
5. Synapse X library syntax highlighting within the AceEditor!
6. (Actually) working AceEditor script file system!
7. Built-in error help information!
8. Easy installation!
9. And much more!

# Installation
The installation is super simple. 

Simply head over to the ["Releases"](https://github.com/slash1div/SynapseUI/releases) tab and download the latest SynapseUI.exe from under the Assets.

Once downloaded, simply drag and drop this into your already pre-existing Synapse X folder and open it.

`Note:`
First run may take longer as the UI will auto-download all the required files.

This Synapse UI can auto-update both itself and the additional files. Meaning you will automatically get the latest version of this UI.

# Key shortcuts
- Ctrl+S : Save opened script file.
- Ctrl+Shift+S : Save script files as.
- Ctrl+O : Open script file into editor.

# Notes
1. Make sure to add this custom UI to your antivirus exclusions list, this is obviously not a virus, it's an open-source project.
2. Multi-RBLX is buggy, always has been - its the nature of the method. To get best results: 
    - Make sure you turn Multi-RBLX `ON` first THEN open up your roblox clients. \*Turning Multi-RBLX `OFF` closes all clients but one.

I will be updating this UI at some point in the future with new features and bug fixes, DM me with any known bug fixes / any features you might want added.

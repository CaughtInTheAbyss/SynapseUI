# Installation
The installation is super simple. 

Simply head over to the ["Releases"](https://github.com/asunax-aaa/SynapseUI/releases) tab and download the latest SynapseUI.exe from under the Assets.

Once downloaded, simply drag and drop this into your already pre-existing Synapse X folder and open it.

`Note:`
First run may take longer as the UI will auto-download all the required files.

This Synapse UI can auto-update both itself and the additional files. Meaning you will automatically get the latest version of this UI.

# Key shortcuts
- Ctrl+S : Save opened script file.
- Ctrl+Shift+S : Save script files as.
- Ctrl+O : Open script file into editor.

# Todo
There's still one or two things that the original Synapse UI has that this custom one does not.

Such as:
1. Opening scripts that were previously opened, `CURRENTLY WHEN YOU CLOSE THIS CUSTOM UI, SCRIPTS DO NOT SAVE! USE CTRL+S TO SAVE SCRIPTS`
2. Add AceEdtior themes, easily to implement - will appear in next update.
